\usage{
covid19(
  country = NULL,
  level = 1,
  start = "2010-01-01",
  end = Sys.Date(),
  raw = FALSE,
  vintage = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  cache = TRUE,
  wb = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{country}{vector of country names or \href{https://github.com/covid19datahub/COVID19/blob/master/inst/extdata/db/ISO.csv}{ISO codes} (alpha-2, alpha-3 or numeric).}

\item{level}{integer. Granularity level. 1: country-level data. 2: state-level data. 3: lower-level data.}

\item{start}{the start date of the period of interest.}

\item{end}{the end date of the period of interest.}

\item{raw}{logical. Skip data cleaning? Default \code{FALSE}. See details.}

\item{vintage}{logical. Retrieve the snapshot of the dataset that was generated at the \code{end} date instead of using the latest version. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{logical. Print data sources? Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{cache}{logical. Memory caching? Significantly improves performance on successive calls. Default \code{TRUE}.}

\item{wb}{character vector of \href{https://data.worldbank.org}{World Bank} indicator codes. See details.}
}
\value{
Grouped \code{tibble} (\code{data.frame}). See the \href{https://covid19datahub.io/articles/doc/data.html}{dataset description}
}
\description{
Unified datasets for a better understanding of COVID-19.
}
\details{
The raw data are cleaned by filling missing dates with \code{NA} values. 
This ensures that all locations share the same grid of dates and no single day is skipped. 
Then, \code{NA} values are replaced with the previous non-\code{NA} value or \code{0}.

The dataset can be extended with \href{https://data.worldbank.org}{World Bank Open Data} via the argument \code{wb}, a character vector of indicator codes.
The codes can be found by inspecting the corresponding URL. For example, the code of the GDP indicator available at \url{https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD} is \code{NY.GDP.MKTP.CD}.
The latest data available between the \code{start} and \code{end} date are downloaded.
